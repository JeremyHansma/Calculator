# Calculator
Calculator for the Odin Project.

Contains functions for all basic math operators:
Add
Subtract
Multiply
Divide

Has a function, operate, that takes an operator and 2 numbers then calls on any of the above functions on the numbers
Points for this function:

-Make it so a button press will equate to one variable (number) and another button press will equate to another. 
-Operate function should be called when  user presses = button
-Each of the math operators will have a button that has the function connected to it. 
-The calculator will take the initial value set by the first digit press but not the second 

Create HTML calculator layout
-Create a display for the calculator that displays the results, can hold 0 as the initial value
-Add a clear button
There should be a “display value” variable that is stored for later use.
